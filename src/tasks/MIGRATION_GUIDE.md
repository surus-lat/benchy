# Task Migration Guide (Deprecated)

All evaluation tasks now run natively in Benchy. If you need to add a new task, use:

- `src/tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` for structure and expectations
- `src/tasks/translation/` and `src/tasks/spanish/` for reference implementations

This file is kept as a placeholder to avoid broken references in older notes.
